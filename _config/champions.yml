  description: I was born in Houston, Texas 1969. I graduated from the University of Houston with honors with a B.F.A. in Graphic Communications and spent several years doing traditional print graphic design/corporate branding before becoming infatuated with multi-media. Spent my formative web years pursuing user interface design and web branding during the height of the Internet boom. I've worked on a wide variety of corporate websites, portals and intranets. Prior to joining JBoss, designed user interfaces for CRM and website management applications for the automotive industry. I'm dedicated to making JBoss.org the best resource possible for the open source community.
